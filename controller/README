All stuff related to the controller goes here.
It includes tracking and localization, motion planning, etc that run on a _super_ computer outside the contest field but next to the two skillful operators.
We run ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Tips:

1) modify your .bashrc to include this line:
source /home/tor/robotics/prj/013/ws/trui-bot-prj/controller/devel/setup.bash
2) ask the Mechanical Team for the mesh files to put under <...>/controller/src/rbmt_urdf/mesh/
3) install some stacks:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-navigation
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-mavlink
4) for removing build/ and devel/ for _clean_ catkin_make:
$ ./clean.sh
